Composite Pattern
---

The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
This pattern allows us to create a complex and nested data structure.
Through the use of interfaces, we can create tree nodes (Menus) and leafs (Menu Items).
Through the power of recursion, we can create functions that traverse the tree and return the desired result.

Combining this technique with the iterator pattern allows us to create code that easily traverses the tree regardless of node or leaf status.
