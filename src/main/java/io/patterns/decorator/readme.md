Decorator Pattern 
---

The Decorator Pattern attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. 
Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
 
Decorators can be used on their own or wrapped around another component to extend their behaviour.
Each decorator HAS-A a component which allows us to dynamically change the behaviour during runtime.
