Template Method
---

The Template Method Pattern defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses. 
Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.
 
Effectively, this method makes it easy to standardize procedures, but parts of the procedures can be overridden by the sub-classes to obtain custom behaviour.
