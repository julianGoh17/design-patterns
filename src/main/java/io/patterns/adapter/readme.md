Adapter Pattern
---

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. 
Adapter lets classes work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
The pattern allows for clients to not have to rework their code. 
For example, a client has created their codebase to work on a certain API, but want to move to a new API with different parameters. 
We can simply write an adapter to convert the old API calls to new code.
